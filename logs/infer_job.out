--- Example Prompt ---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Determine how the following premise and hypothesis are related. If the hypothesis follows from the premise, select "entailment". If they contradict each other, select "contradiction". If the statements do not entail nor contradict each other, select "neutral". Premise: Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again. Hypothesis: I havent spoken to him again.

### Response:
